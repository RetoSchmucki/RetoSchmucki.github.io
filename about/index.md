#### Research

In my research, I examine the processes that drive population dynamics, structure communities and mediate biological diversity across scales. I am particularly interested in understanding the determinants of species distribution and community dynamics in human-dominated landscapes. My main interests are in community and population ecology, spatial modelling and conservation biology.
